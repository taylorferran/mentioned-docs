# Mentioned

Mentioned is a mention market prediction platform built on Solana. Users trade on whether specific words will be mentioned in defined contexts.

## How it works

Markets are created around sets of words. For each word, users can buy **YES** or **NO** positions — betting on whether that word will be mentioned. Trades are matched, tokens are minted for both sides, and when the market resolves, winning token holders claim their SOL.

## Key concepts

- **Market** — A collection of words to trade on, deployed as a Solana program
- **YES/NO tokens** — Minted when a trade is matched, representing each side of the bet
- **Escrow** — Users deposit SOL before trading and withdraw after resolution
- **Resolution** — Markets are resolved per word with a YES or NO outcome
