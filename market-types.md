# Market Types

Mentioned can curate a market around anything with an audience and words. If people are watching, listening, or reading — and words are being said or written — there's a market.

### Timing Markets

Not just *if* a word is said, but *when*.

| YouTube timing | Will the sponsor plug happen before the 2 minute mark? |

## What makes a good Mentioned market

- **Clear source** — the content is publicly available and verifiable
- **Known timing** — there's a scheduled release or event date
- **Audience interest** — people care enough to have an opinion
- **Word ambiguity** — the outcome isn't obvious (50/50 splits drive volume)
- **Resolvable** — we can definitively say YES or NO after the event
